## ðŸ’» How it works

Made to show off my skills and demonstrate all my knowledge. Good design with smooth animations for better navigation. 

## ðŸš€ How it was made

This site was built with the trinity of the Web: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The animations were made with the Animate On Scroll library. An intuitive and super easy to use tool.

Figma was used to make the layout, where all the colors and fonts of the application were taken.

The logo was made with a special font and was animated with pure CSS.

The form is fully functional. An external API hosted by StaticForms was used.

The carousel used in the portfolio section was built using the Swiper.js library which is a great tool for this purpose.

The gallery was made using isotope.js. There are several categories within this library, including the mansory which was used on my web site.

There is also the embedded google map.
