## ðŸ’» How it works

Made to show off my skills and demonstrate all my knowledge. Good design with smooth animations for better navigation. 

## ðŸš€ How it was made

#### Trinity
> This site was built with the trinity of the Web: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

#### AOS Library
> The animations were made with the Animate On Scroll library. An intuitive and super easy to use tool.

#### Figma
> Figma was used to make the layout, where all the colors and fonts of the application were taken.

#### CSS Animation
> The logo was made with a special font and was animated with pure CSS.

#### StaticForms API
> The form is fully functional. An external API hosted by StaticForms was used.

#### Swiper.js Library
> The carousel used in the portfolio section was built using the Swiper.js library which is a great tool for this purpose.

#### Isotope.js Library
> The gallery was made using isotope.js. There are several categories within this library, including the mansory which was used on my web site.

#### Google Maps
> There is also the embedded google map.
